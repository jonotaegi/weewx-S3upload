# weewx-s3

This repository is a fork of https://github.com/wmadill/weewx-S3upload,
a weeWX extension to sync web files to an AWS S3 bucket.

This is a weeWX extension to sync web files to an AWS S3 bucket.

Rather than serving the web pages generated by weeWX directly from a 
webserver running on the same system as weeWX, I upload those pages 
to an AWS S3 bucket. The bucket is configured to be a static website
and is costing me around USD 0.50/month. This is cheaper than usual 
website hosting and saves me the worry of someone hacking into the
system running weeWX.

This has been tested against weeWX 3.8.2.

## Setup

Before installing this extensions, get an S3 bucket at Amazon
https://aws.amazon.com/. Sign into the management consule, create an
account if necessary, then create an S3 bucket.

Search their help pages for how to set up the bucket as a static
website. You'll need to add a DNS record for the URL you choose for
accessing the bucket.

Install `s3cmd` from http://s3tools.org/s3cmd. It is a Python 2.x
tool so will run fine on the same computer as weeWX. This has been
tested with s3cmd 2.0.2.
